# Hej, my name is Johan ðŸ‘‹

I am a software freelancer based in Sweden, passionate about 
accessability (a11y), security, and creating delightful user 
experiences.

I have experience working across frontend, backend, devops, and mobile 
apps, supporting diverse users such as newspaper readers, healthcare 
professionals, job seekers, HR teams, among others.

I'm always excited to make a meaningful impact, help even more people, 
and solve challenges while hopefully learning something new along the 
way.

Have a project in mind or just want to reach out to say hi?
