# Hej, my name is Johan ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer and enthusiast currently living in Sweden. I am
 passionate about accessability (a11y), security, and creating 
delightful user experiences. I appreciate interfaces and I also play 
music occasionally.
 
Have a project in mind or just want to reach out to say hi?
